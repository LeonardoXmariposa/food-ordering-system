# 🍔 Food Ordering App – MERN Stack

This Food Ordering System is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to browse restaurants, view menus, add items to a cart, and place orders online in a simple and intuitive way.

The system supports different roles:

- Admins can oversee the entire platform and manage users

Built with a focus on clean design, fast performance, and mobile responsiveness, this application delivers a smooth online ordering experience across all devices.
